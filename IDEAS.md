# Ideas for future sessions
* The RPIs should be loaded with an image pre-configured with the following:
 * A single ssh key, added in the authorized_keys: that way, every RPI can connect to every other without a password.
 * That same ssh key will be added to the github account.
 * The github repo should be pre-loaded into the home of every RPI (with read/write ability)
 * All WIFI config will be done ahead of time.
