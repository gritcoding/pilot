# Scratch + GPIO lesson

In this lesson, we continue using Scratch, using a special GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) enabled build. It will be installed on the Raspberry PI.

## Setup instructions
* Have the kids setup the Raspberry PI by connecting the usual connectors (microSD card, HDMI, mouse, keyboard, power).
* You will also connect the header cable to the breakout board, and insert the breakout board into the breadboard.
